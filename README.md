# phaser_tutorial
First attempt at game creation using phaser tutorial 

This game has a simple list of mechanics: walking, and jumping. Triggered, respectively, by the left or right directional arrows and the up arrow.

The point of the game is simple: to collect all of the stars that are bouncing on the screen. When the player collects a star, the player gains 10 points. When all the stars are collected, the game over is indicated by a sign that says "You win!".

Note: The player is only able to jump if already on the ground(no double jumps allowed!).
